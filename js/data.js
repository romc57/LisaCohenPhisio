    contentHtml: `
      <p>Custom orthotic insoles can reduce pain, improve alignment, and enhance comfort across a wide range of conditions. Below are common problems and how orthotics help in each case.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Heel Spur (Plantar Fasciitis) and Foot Pain:</strong>
          Orthotic insoles help alleviate pain caused by the formation of a heel spur or pain in the foot by distributing pressure across the foot and improving support.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Flatfoot (Fallen Arches):</strong>
          For individuals with flat arches, insoles provide arch support, which helps improve posture and reduce stress on the joints of the feet.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>High Arches:</strong>
          In cases of high arches, insoles help absorb shock and distribute pressure, thereby reducing pain and preventing injuries.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Stress Fractures:</strong>
          Orthotic insoles distribute the load applied to the foot, aiding both the healing and prevention of stress fractures.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Growth-Related Pain:</strong>
          Insoles also help reduce stress and pain caused by growth processes in children and adolescents.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Ankle Instability (Due to Recurrent Sprains):</strong>
          Insoles contribute to ankle stabilization and lower the risk of repeated sprains.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Metatarsal Pain:</strong>
          Custom-fitted insoles distribute weight properly and help relieve pain in the metatarsal bones.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Post-Surgical Foot Care:</strong>
          Personalized insoles assist in the rehabilitation process, improve comfort, and reduce pressure after foot surgeries.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Fractures:</strong>
          Following a fracture, insoles help disperse pressure, improve comfort, and support optimal healing.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you\'re experiencing any of the issues above, a personalized assessment can determine the best orthotic solution for you.</p>
